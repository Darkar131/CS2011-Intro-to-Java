What I have learn in IntToByte.java is to first know what the user might put and how large the number will be, 
for example if the user puts anything larger than 127 its no longer a byte and you will get weird answers from the console.
However, if you can extend that data type from 8bit-byte, 16bit-short, 32bit-int, 64bit-long and so then you will get a output.

My process was first create a class (line 3), 
second creat a method header (line 5), 
third create a new Scanner along with a system propmt for the user (line 6, 7),
fourth what ever input the user puts in for the console to be able to read it and process to get the integer value 
then to not be confuse I put the system output to get the integer value (line 9, 10),
fifth created a variable to store the value and cast it into byte for the same input
then system output to get the byte value of the integer (line 12, 13),
lastly close the method class.

Overall, I though I was confuse at first and re-read more documentation to understand it and became a piece of cake
