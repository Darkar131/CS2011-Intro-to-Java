# CS2011-Intro-to-Java

Learn the fundamentals of computer science using programming language of Java.

Creating simple applications to respond to logic base concepts to create solutions surrounding the problem. Gradually increasing its difficulty as chapters move and
better undertand different approaches to solve the same or similar solutions. Optimazing the code by reducing the functions with better ready functions to minimaze run time errors
and compile errors.

In this formal course has aid to to undertand other programming languages to implement new concepts and solutions as I continually learn.
